    <h2>mountains and moon </h2>
    <p>  
      Rocks in the Beartooth Mountains are like a sliver of the Moon in miniature. The mountains of Montana contain rocks that are like those we find on the Moon</p><br>
      <p>Mountains on the Moon
        On the barren floor of the Mare Imbrium are two of the most impressive single mountain peaks on the surface of the moon, Mons Piton and Mons Pico. The Mons Piton has a base 16 miles (25 kilometers) in diameter and towers 7,380 feet (2,250 m) over the surrounding plain.</p><br>
        <p> The highest mountain and volcano in the Solar System is on the planet Mars. It is called Olympus Mons and is 16 miles (24 kilometers) high which makes it about three times higher than Mt. Everest.</p><br>
        <P>auna Kea volcano
          That title goes to Mauna Kea volcano on Hawaii. Much of its base is on the ocean floor, nearly 6,000m below the surface. Its peak is the highest point in the state of Hawaii, giving an overall height of 10,000m</P><br>
